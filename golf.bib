  abstract = {This Atlas accompanies a much larger set of maps, published simultaneously here on Figshare. In the map set, there is one map for each local authority in the United Kingdom.\\
This report provides an introduction to the project, explains what Corine data is and provides an overview of land cover in the United Kingdom. It also looks a little more closely at land cover in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.\\
It includes some local maps of land cover plus two Appendices. Appendix 1 provides further details on the Corine Land Cover 2012 classification used herein and Appendix 2 provides some further supplementary data tables. \\
Overall, the UK is nearly 29\% pasture land and just over 27\% non-irrigated arable land. In terms of land cover, the UK is less than 6\% urban. See this report and the associated maps for more detail.\\
